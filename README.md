# Test assignment

For the test assignment, we have a partly finished banking application (created only for test assignment purposes), where one account can send money to another.
This application is far from perfect, so we need you to fix and finish it by paying attention to these factors:
 * **Security** - we do not want to be hacked
 * **Best practices** - code should be clean and easy to maintain
 * **Documentation** - provide information on how to set up the project
 * **Tests** - test the parts that you feel necessary to
 * **Logic** - bank should not allow overspending your balance

Authentication **IS NOT** in the scope of this assignment. Getting the transactions list with the request `GET /accounts/<id>/transactions` is not a security hole.
